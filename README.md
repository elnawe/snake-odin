# Snake-Odin

Making my first game in Odin with the help of Raylib. It's just a simple, one-file game, where you play as a apple-eating snake.

This is the first thing I did with Odin, so testing the different capabilities with the language and playing with it. Code could be better.

Have fun!

## Build from source

You'll need the [Odin compiler](https://odin-lang.org/).

After installing it:

```
git clone httsp://github.com/elnawe/snake-odin
cd snake-odin
odin run .
```

## Playing it

You can also get the binary on the [Release page](https://github.com/elnawe/snake-odin/releases).
